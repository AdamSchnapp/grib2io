version 1.4 (not yet released)
==============================
* added __dealloc__ method to gribmessage to allow for garbage collection.
  Prevents out of memory errors when iterating over large numbers of grib
  messages.

version 1.3 - svn revision 153
==============================
* make sure gribmessage instances are created from clones
  of grib handle, so information is retained when state of parent
  grib iterator is modified.

version 1.2 - svn revision 152
==============================
* fix issue 2 - segault when iterating over certain grib files 
  (those at ftp://ftp.ssec.wisc.edu/pub/eosdb/dbcras, for example).

version 1.1 - svn revision 147
==============================
* fix segfault that occured when iterator hit end of file and grib message was
  accessed.
* fix __repr__ so level information is correctly printed for GRIB1 files.
* fix setup.py to find openjpeg and jasper headers on Ubuntu.
* use doctest in test.py.

version 1.0 - svn revision 124
==============================
* fix formatting of analysis time in gribmessage __repr__.
* add command line utilites grib_list and grib_repack.
* added support for rotated lat/lon and gaussian grids in latlons().

version 1.0b1 - svn revision 91
===============================
* basic write support through __setitem__ (to modify an existing grib
  message) and tostring (to get the encoded binary string that can
  be written to a file).  This allows modifications to an existing grib
  message, but not the creation of a new grib message from scratch.

version 1.0a1 - svn revision 55
===============================
* initial release.  Support for reading GRIB1 and GRIB2 is nearly complete.
  No support for writing yet.
