version 1.7 - svn revision 248
==============================
* grib_api_version module variable contains version info for grib_api lib.
* added *_LIBDIR and *_INCDIR env vars to setup.py for more flexible
  specification of library and include dir locations.
* fix bugs in handling of scale factor for radius of the earth.
* some grids use the key "projectionCentreFlag",
  while some use "projectionCenterFlag". Account for 
  both possibilities (added to test_stere.py).
* missingvalue_int and missingvalue_float are now module variables
  (not instance variables).
* raise error if no keys are specified when creating index instance.

version 1.6.1 - svn revision 227
================================
* only print ensemble info in __repr__ (which is called when 'print grb' is
  done) when both both 'perturbationNumber' and 'typeOfEnsembleForecast' keys are
  present. Fixes error on 'print grb' for ERA-interim grib files.

version 1.6 - svn revision 223
==============================
* raise IOError when grib message number < 1 is accessed with message method
  (instead of segfaulting, which is rude).  Fixes issue 4.
* indexing open instance (iterator) with an integer key now is the same as
  calling the message method (grbs.message(2) == grbs[2]).
* slicing iterator now also works (grbs[::2] returns every other grib message
  in a list).
* added 'select' method to open instance for selecting grib messages based
  on key/value pairs.
* added 'index' class which can be used for fast subsettting of grib files 
  based on specified key/value pairs (a faster alternative to 'select' method
  of open instance).
* fixes for grib_api version 1.9.0 (the names of some keys changed).

version 1.5 - svn revsion 187
=============================
* fix bug in latlons method for space_view grids not centered
  on the equator at Greenwich.
* compatibility fixes for version 1.8.0.1 of grib_api definitions
  (the names of several keys changed from version 1.8.0).
* use __cinit__ to initialize C level objects, __init__ for
  python level objects (instead of doing everything in __new__).

version 1.4 - svn revision 172
==============================
* allow gribmessage keys to be set or accessed like attributes.
* added __dealloc__ method to gribmessage to allow for garbage collection.
  Prevents out of memory errors when iterating over large numbers of grib
  messages.

version 1.3 - svn revision 153
==============================
* make sure gribmessage instances are created from clones
  of grib handle, so information is retained when state of parent
  grib iterator is modified.

version 1.2 - svn revision 152
==============================
* fix issue 2 - segault when iterating over certain grib files 
  (those at ftp://ftp.ssec.wisc.edu/pub/eosdb/dbcras, for example).

version 1.1 - svn revision 147
==============================
* fix segfault that occured when iterator hit end of file and grib message was
  accessed.
* fix __repr__ so level information is correctly printed for GRIB1 files.
* fix setup.py to find openjpeg and jasper headers on Ubuntu.
* use doctest in test.py.

version 1.0 - svn revision 124
==============================
* fix formatting of analysis time in gribmessage __repr__.
* add command line utilites grib_list and grib_repack.
* added support for rotated lat/lon and gaussian grids in latlons().

version 1.0b1 - svn revision 91
===============================
* basic write support through __setitem__ (to modify an existing grib
  message) and tostring (to get the encoded binary string that can
  be written to a file).  This allows modifications to an existing grib
  message, but not the creation of a new grib message from scratch.

version 1.0a1 - svn revision 55
===============================
* initial release.  Support for reading GRIB1 and GRIB2 is nearly complete.
  No support for writing yet.
