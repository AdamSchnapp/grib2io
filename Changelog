* fix setup.py to find openjpeg and jasper headers on Ubuntu.
* use doctest in test.py.

version 1.0 - svn revision 124
==============================
* fix formatting of analysis time in gribmessage __repr__.
* add command line utilites grib_list and grib_repack.
* added support for rotated lat/lon and gaussian grids in latlons().

version 1.0b1 - svn revision 91

  message, but not the creation of a new grib message from scratch.
