Although pygrib is not yet part of MacPorts (http://www.macports.org), you can use the 
include Portfile to install it using a local Portfile repository.  See ports/README
for more details.  Once macports is installed, and your local Portfile repo is set up,
all you have to do to install pygrib and it's dependencies is run "sudo port install py-pygrib".

google "macports local portfile" for more information on creating a local Portfile repository.

pygrib has been submitted to the macports tracker, but has not yet been accepted.  
The ticket is here: https://trac.macports.org/ticket/32192.
